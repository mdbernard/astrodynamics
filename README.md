This repo contains general code developed for an undergraduate orbital mechanics course. It might contain bugs; use at your own risk.

In general, the algorithms used are defined in Orbital Mechanics for Engineering Students, 4 ed., Curtis. I have done my best to document where these algorithms were used. Tests use example problems and end-of-chapter problems from the same text, and are documented. If you notice unattributed data, tests, or algorithms, please make an issue so I can correctly credit the author.
